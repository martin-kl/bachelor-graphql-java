# Graphql - Java connection and benchmarking

This piece of software has been created within the context of my bachelor thesis at TU Wien (Vienna) on *Accessing Graph databases with GraphQL and REST* in 2018.

It contains code that either accesses a Neo4J database over GraphQL or REST and times the accesses.
